ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! My name is Temi Jegede. I am a master's student at Georgia Southern University where I am studying computer science. For my undergrad, I graduated with a double major in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in computer science. My focus for my master's program is both software engineering and artificial intelligence. I love learning new technologies and thinking of ways I can apply things I build in the real world. I am very open to job opportunities because I will be graduating in May 2023. I am open to software engineer and machine learning engineer roles.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on full stack web development, mobile application development, and ML/AI.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mastering springboot, spring security, tensorflow, algorithmic trading with C++, Web3, and AWS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project I have the skills to add value to.
